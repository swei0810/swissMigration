Data visualization of Swiss migration

# Background and Overview

In preparation for going abroad to Geneva, Switzerland in Spring 2020, I am currently taking a class on Geneva Colloquium (POSC 300). We were assigned to read various articles regarding Swiss citizenship or migration processes and was asked to create a quantitative assignment using Excel. Having been exposed to D3.js recently, I decided to take another step and decided to use D3.js instead of Excel to learn more about D3 data manipulation. Results are simple charts that answer questions I had about Swiss citizenship. 


# Functionality and MVP Features



# Architecture and Technologies
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

  * Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure
  * D3 for map and bubble chart 
  * Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.


# Data sets 
All the data was gathered from Federal Statistical Office.
